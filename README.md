# Improvement

Add unit tests:
* Test HTTP EndPoint
* Test DataBase CRUD

Perform better error management.

Check that dependencies exist when creating or modifying an object.
For exemple, when we create a People object, we don't check if the parameter homeworld_id corresponding to an existing object in database.

Link films, starship, vehicles and species to a People

# Known issues

Relationships Many to Many between People and Species doesn't work.  
For exemple when I get one People By Id, I Preload Species entities but in the response 
there are not spacies.
